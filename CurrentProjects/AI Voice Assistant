This is a current project that I have been working on. The code uses a python file to immitate speaking to an AI voice assistant
that has the capabilities to perfomr certain tasks on your computer and potientially around your home. Soon, the AI will be able
to use natual language processing to develop unique responses to every question ask to make conversation feel more fluid and natural. 
As of now the AI is currently able to pull up/navigate desktop pages, give an accurate answer for the current weather, set timers, and refer
to wikipedia to answer any who or what kind questions. There are many future capabiblites that will be added, with a focus on NLPs and 
home automation. As of right now, responses are stored within my JSON file. My python file then navigates to the json file when it hears
the correct key word/key phrases, and then chooses randomly from 7-8 responses to create the impression that it is always giving a unique 
responds. This is a beginners project and hopefully in the future, the AI itself will become more advance.
