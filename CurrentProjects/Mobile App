One of the current projects that I have worked on has been for a company overseas. The project uses flutter, dart, and json to achieve the 
desired output. However the original code was written in vba for excel, i had to translate it to previously mentioned program languages 
to accomplish the same task. The company specialized in natural stone and they wanted me to created an mobile app that 
allowed users to pick certain selections from dropdown widgets and based on the selections that they made, multiple stones will show 
up as results allowing the user to see what the best stone will be for them. The dart code uses multiple animation to bring life to ceratin 
pages and there was navigation from page to page.
